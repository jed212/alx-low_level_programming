# An Introduction to Makefiles
* You need a file called a `makefile` to tell make what to do. Most often, the makefile tells `make` how to compile and link a program.
* The makefile can also tell make how to run miscellaneous commands when explicitly asked (for example, to remove certain files as a clean-up operation)
